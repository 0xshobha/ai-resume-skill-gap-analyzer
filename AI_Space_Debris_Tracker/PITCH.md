**(0:00-0:30) The Hook (The Problem)**
"Hello Judges! Imagine driving a car on a highway, but instead of other cars, you are surrounded by thousands of 17,000-mile-per-hour bullets. That is what it's like for satellites in space today.
We rely on satellites for GPS, Internet, and Weather, but they are in danger. There are millions of pieces of space debris—dead rockets and junk—threatening to destroy them. Just one collision could start a chain reaction that traps us on Earth forever."

**(0:30-1:00) The Solution**
"I present **Orbit Guard**, an AI-powered visualization tool designed to make this invisible danger visible.
My web app gives you a 3D interactive view of Earth's orbit. It tracks active satellites in GREEN and dangerous debris in RED. Simple, intuitive, and effective."

**(1:00-1:30) How It Works (The 'Brain')**
"But it's not just a map. It has a brain. 
Behind the scenes, my system runs a collision detection algorithm. It continuously calculates the 3D Euclidean distance between every single object. 
If a piece of debris gets too close to a satellite, the system instantly flags it as a 'HIGH RISK' alert on the dashboard, simulating how real space agencies decide when to move a satellite."

**(1:30-1:50) The Tech Stack**
"I built this using Python and Flask for the backend logic, and Plotly.js for the 3D rendering. It’s designed to be lightweight, educational, and accessible to anyone—even students like me."

**(1:50-2:00) Conclusion**
"Space is our future. To explore it, we must protect it. Orbit Guard is the first step in understanding that challenge. Thank you!"
